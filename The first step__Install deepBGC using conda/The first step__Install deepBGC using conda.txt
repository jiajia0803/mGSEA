# Add the bioconda channel and conda-forge.
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
#Create a virtual environment for deepBGC and install dependent tools.
conda create -n deepbgc python=3.7 hmmer prodigal
#Activate the deepBGC virtual environment.
conda activate deepbgc
#Install deepBGC.
conda install deepbgc
#Download the pre-trained models and Pfam database.
deepbgc download
#Check the downloaded dependencies and models.
